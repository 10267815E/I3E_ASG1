## Premise
Player is trapped in a research facility and has to collect all 5 energy sources to power the generator in the main floor. Due to the loss of power, barrels filled with toxic waste has erupted outside the lab, the processing facilities have all gone haywire, and the player's own creations have even gone rogue! The player must restore power to the facility and put an end to the accidental death traps now littered across the building and beyond.

## Game Outline

1. Player starts off the game in the ground floor, and has to find the first energy source (the green one) hidden in the pile of crates beside spawn. Keep in mind that the player can only escape the main building (indoor area) after obtaining the first three energy sources.

2. After going to the second floor, the player would find himself face to face with the second energy source, however, he'll have to traverse the conveyor belts that have now gone haywire. At the end of each conveyor belt is a death brick that will instantly kill the player. 

3. After obtaining the second energy source, the player now has to get past the pool of toxic waste in the third floor by jumping on the pillars. However, they also have to watch out for the processing machine (the rotating arm in the middle) that will hit them into the toxic pool.

4. Three energy sources later, the player now finds himself escaping the main building itself, however he still has two more energy sources to collect. In front of him is the busy junction outside the building, where the lost of power has caused the self-driving trucks the player was developing to gone haywire, mindlessly and recklessly driving back and forth the road at rapid speeds. As the player traverses past the three trucks, he will obtain the fourth energy source.

5. Finally, the player has to go to the back of the facility and encounter the barrels of uranium that have exploded due to the loss of power. Every time the player steps into the pool of uranium, he loses 10 health per 0.3 seconds.

6. As the player collects the last energy source, he reactivates the generator and restores power to the facility, winning the game.

## Bugs and Limitations.
After testing, I've found that the player can actually glitch through the wall and bypass it without interacting to open it.
